  desc: A colleague of mine and I developed and presented an idea that helps doctors track early signs of dementia. Our idea was a chrome extension which tracked a users keyboard use over a number of years, storing data and finding specific rhythms and trends. We placed in the top 10 worldwide. The extension was developed using python and pytorch.

  desc: For my fourth year project I am currently developing a decentralised application for doctors to store MRI scan images on a blockchain using a peer-to-peer network, while having the ability to analyse these images through a convolutional neural network. I am developing the application using react, python and solidity.
